## Scratch
Minor scratches are often cosmetic. Ask for:
- close-up angle
- wide shot including the whole panel
- side lighting to reveal depth

Typical actions:
- polish / repaint
- auto-approve is possible only for minor scratch with high confidence

Risks:
- scratch may include clearcoat + basecoat damage
- photo compression can hide depth

## Dent
Moderate dents may require technician verification. Ask for:
- angle that shows curvature
- distance shot to confirm panel alignment
- note if dent is near structural elements

Potential risks:
- hidden damage under the panel
- repair vs replacement decision depends on location and depth

## Paint Damage
If paint damage is isolated, standard estimate applies.
If paint damage is widespread, route for review and request additional photos.

## Escalation
Escalate if:
- severity is severe
- dent impacts structural area
- uncertainty remains after additional photos
